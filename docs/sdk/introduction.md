## How to get access to the mediQuo SDK

### Step 1: Apply and receive approval for your organization

Before integrate the SDK, you must first [apply for an organization account](https://www.mediquo.com/en/companies/) and have your use case validated. Once validated, you will be provided with a set of credentials that will allow you to initialize the SDK.

### Step 2: Synchronize your patients using the mediQuo API

To authenticate your users in the SDK, you must first register them on our platform and send us their basic data (the minimum necessary for proper medical assistance) using the [mediQuo API](/docs/api/introduction/).

### Step 3: Integrate your SDK within you app

At this point you will be able to integrate properly the SDK within your apps following the steps described in the
[Android SDK documentation](/docs/sdk/android/introduction/)
and the [iOS SDK documentation](/docs/sdk/ios/introduction/).
