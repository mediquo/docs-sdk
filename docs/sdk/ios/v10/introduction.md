## Welcome v10!

We are happy to announce that we have a new version of the iOS SDK. This new version is a complete rewrite of the previous one with a lot of improvements.

The v10 version includes a lot of **breaking changes**, so we recommend you to read carefully the new [documentation](https://github.com/mediquo/mediquo-ios-sdk).

Contact to the MediQuo technical team for any question or issue.
